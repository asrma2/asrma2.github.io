# About
In this project I made a interactive narration style experience. In this, user's experience changes upon his/her choice. \\
For this project I edited and stiched the 360 video to make a narration. Then I made custom 360 video player in Unity with controls, particles, titles, credits, and interactions.

# Videos made
For this I edited two medium length videos:

1. **A Voyage Through Europe**

2. **An Asian Odyssey**
