# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
From my childhood, I loved solving puzzles. And this is what fascinates me towards software development. The potential to solve many real-life problems to help people is just amazing. And I think mindset matters the most. That's why I love developing new things in a better way and then constantly improving that. 


Apart from this, I love playing and watching Football. It just teaches me many lessons that I use in my life. I play many other sports also like Basketball, Cricket, and Badminton.
