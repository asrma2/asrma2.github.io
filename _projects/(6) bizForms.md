# About

This project was done for PROT Systems.

The product allows the user to create various congurable forms and then store records or entries in it. The form data can then be used to create multiple reports. Reports module provides user with the option to make different charts of the data of a particular form. There were many charts available for the
user like bar, line, pie, nested pie and many more. The user is also provided with the aggregation
functions like Sum, Count, Min, Max, and Average. We used ZingChart Library to provide customizable charts to the user.
