description: Making the trasmission of data between two IoT devices more secure.

# About

The main aim of the project was to design and build a specification for the encryption of
electronic data that dynamically moves between different IoT devices. We want to code an
efficient algorithm that can encrypt and decrypt data in very less amount of time. We used AES
(Advanced Encryption Standard) Algorithm to encrypt the data before sending it to the
network.
