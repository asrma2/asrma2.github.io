# About

This project was done for PROT Systems.

The main aim of the project was to build a product based on the SaaS-based model. We needed
to design a model so that the developed product can be used by multiple organizations
maintaining the privacy for all the organizations. A store that is created is provided with features like maintaing its products, customers orders etc. The admin can cahnge various properties of an individual store like themes, pages etc.
