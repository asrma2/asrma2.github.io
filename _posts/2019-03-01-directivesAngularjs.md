## Introduction

We as developers can easily accept that Angular JS has helped us a lot in linking HTML code with JS. It has extended HTML with a new set of attributes known as Directives. Many functionalities can be easily done with the help of Angular directives. It helps us to do a task in efficient manner. It has built-in directives that offers functionality to our applications. We can also define our own custom directives according to our requirement. Angular Directives are of three types: Components Directives, Structural Directives and Attribute Directives.


## Components Directives

This is the base of our application. Without using this derivative it would not be possible to make an Angular application. Ng-app is one of the example of components directives. The component containing ng-app is the root element of the Angular JS. 


## Structural Directives

Structural Directives are used to change the DOM layout. They help us in forming DOM structure by manipulating different elements. They are responsible for HTML layout. Even if you donâ€™t know about these directives, you have definitely used in once in your life. Ng-if, ng-repeat, etc. are some of the commonly used structural directives. Ng-if conditionally includes a template based on the value of an expression coerced to Boolean. Ng-repeat helps us in repeating a set of HTML code until the condition goes wrong. It relieves us from writing long HTML code. You can relate it with loops. There are many of these directives which reduces a lot of our efforts. Some of them are: ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch, 'ng-template', 'ng-container', etc.

## Attribute Directives 

Unlike Structural Directives, Attribute Directives changes appearance of an element, components, or another directive. As the name suggests, it is used as attributes for an element. These directives are as same as regular HTML attributes in templates. Just like a class attribute to give some specific properties to an element, there is ng-class where we can give different classes to an element based on some condition.
